	<p>The final of our 3 dogs, Jean-Luc.  Jean-Luc is significantly smaller than his brothers, as he was the runt of his litter.  He still has a runt complex, and will sometimes fight over food with his brothers, even though they get fed equally.  Here is some other information about Jean-Luc:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Jean-Luc was named for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard" target="_blank">Jean-Luc Picard</a>, Captain of the Enterprise on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation" target="_blank">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a>.</li>
		<li>Jean-Luc is <i>HORRIFIED</i> of feet.  If he sees feet near him, he will shreik and run away.</li>
		<li>Although he is a dog, Jean-Luc often acts like a cat.  Likes to be in high places, alone in the dark, wants attention only occasionally, etc...</li>
		<li>Has on multiple occasions turned the TV on while we've been away.</li>
	</ul>
