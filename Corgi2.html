	<p>This is Loki, the second of my 3 dogs.  We have dubbed him "Dog of Chaos and Mischief", as he lives up to his namesake, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki" target="_blank"> Loki: the Norse God of Mischief</a>, although we did name him a few weeks after seeing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(film)" target="_blank">Thor</a> in theaters.  Here are some additional facts about Loki:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Loki hates thunder.  He's likely not overly fond of what follows.</li>
		<li>He is a complete momma's boy.  Always has to be able to have access to his mommy.</li>
		<li>REALLY hates animals on TV.  Especially if they talk.  <i>Cartoon animals count.</i></li>
		<li>Can escape any prison.  Escaped our house and fenced yard 1 hour before our wedding.</li>
	</ul>
